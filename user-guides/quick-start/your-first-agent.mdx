### Choose Your Training Data

Your AI Agent needs information to learn from. You can train it using various data sources:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Files">
    **Upload your documents**

    Train your agent on your documents.

    **Best for:** Business documents, manuals, FAQs, product information, etc.

    <img src="/images/user-guides/quick-start/first-agent/file-upload.png" alt="File upload interface for training data" />
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Raw Text">
    **Paste text directly**

    Add text content directly without uploading files.

    **Best for:** Copy-pasted content, quick testing, formatted text snippets.

    <img src="/images/user-guides/quick-start/first-agent/text-content.png" alt="Text content input interface" />
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Website">
    **Crawl your website**

    Automatically scrape content from your website URL.

    **Best for:** Documentation sites, blogs, knowledge bases, product pages.

    <img src="/images/user-guides/quick-start/first-agent/website.png" alt="Website crawling interface" />

    **Individual Links**

    You can also add specific individual page URLs instead of crawling the entire site. This gives you precise control over which pages to include in your training data.

    <img src="/images/user-guides/quick-start/first-agent/individual.png" alt="Individual link input interface" />
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Q&A">
    **Add question-answer pairs**

    Create specific Q&A pairs for precise responses.

    **Best for:** FAQs, common customer questions, specific scenarios.

    <img src="/images/user-guides/quick-start/first-agent/qa.png" alt="Q&A pairs input interface" />
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Notion">
    **Connect your Notion workspace**

    Import content directly from your Notion pages.

    **Best for:** Teams already using Notion for documentation and knowledge management.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Review & Start Training

Click **"Create Agent"** to begin the training process.

<img src="/images/user-guides/quick-start/first-agent/train-agent.png" alt="Train Agent button to start training process" />

Training typically takes 2-5 minutes depending on the amount of data. You can proceed to the next step while training completes.

<Note>
**Character Limits:** Different plans have different character limits for training data. Check your plan if you hit any limits.
</Note>

## Step 2: Test & Optimize Your AI Agent

### Access the Playground

Once training begins, you'll automatically be taken to the [**Playground**](/user-guides/agent/playground) - your testing environment where you can chat with your AI Agent and fine-tune it before making it live.

<img src="/images/user-guides/quick-start/first-agent/test-agent.png" alt="Playground interface showing chat testing area" />

### Evaluate Response Quality

As you test, look for:

- **Accuracy** - Are responses factually correct?
- **Relevance** - Does it answer what was asked?
- **Completeness** - Are responses comprehensive but concise?
- **Tone** - Does it match your brand voice?

### Fine-tune Settings

- AI Model
- Instructions
- Temperature

### Test Responses with Different Models

**1. Test with different models**

Ask the same questions to different models and compare:

- **Response quality and accuracy**
- **Response time and speed**
- **Tone and personality**
- **Handling of edge cases**

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/chatbase/4kdBs__Z0wOL088A/user-guides/quick-start/images/first-agent/playground-select-models.png" alt="Playground interface showing select models button" />

**2. Make Your Decision**

Based on the comparison, select the model that best fits your specific use case and brand voice.

For detailed model comparisons and advanced testing strategies, check out our [comprehensive model comparison guide](/user-guides/agent/playground#compare-area).

## Step 3: Deploy to Your Website

### Navigate to the Deploy Section

Once you're satisfied with your AI Agent's responses, it's time to make it live! Navigate to the **"Deploy"** tab in the sidebar, and toggle the switch on the **"Chat widget"** card to enable the agent.

<Warning>
**Disabled vs Enabled:** Disabled agents are only accessible to workspace members. Enabled agents can be embedded on websites and accessed by anyone with the link.
</Warning>

### Choose Your Deployment Method

SoftiusTech offers multiple deployment methods including chat widget, help page, and integrations with WhatsApp, WordPress, and other platforms.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/chatbase/JnjROJ-aB2q57UGe/user-guides/quick-start/images/first-agent/deploy-chat-widget.png" alt="Deploy tab showing many different deployment methods" />

In this guide, we'll use the **Chat widget** option as it's most common. Click on Manage on chat widget then select Embed.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/chatbase/JnjROJ-aB2q57UGe/user-guides/quick-start/images/first-agent/embed-tab.png" alt="chat widget embed tab" />

#### Chat Widget vs iFrame

**Chat Widget (Recommended)** - Perfect for most websites. Adds a floating chat icon that users can click to start conversations. Non-intrusive and mobile-friendly.

**Pros:**
- Can utilize advanced features like identity verification
- Doesn't interfere with your site's design
- Users can minimize/maximize as needed
- Works great on mobile devices
- Familiar UX pattern

**Best for:** Business websites, blogs, e-commerce stores

### Get Your Embed Code

In this guide we'll use the **Chat widget** option. Copy the provided JavaScript code snippet.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/chatbase/JnjROJ-aB2q57UGe/user-guides/quick-start/images/first-agent/copy-embed-code.png" alt="JavaScript embed code ready to copy" />

### Add Code to Your Website

**1. Locate Your Site's HTML**

Find where you can add JavaScript code to your website. This is usually in the `<head>` section or before the closing `</body>` tag.

<Tip>
**For fast loading:** Place the script just before the closing `</body>` tag to ensure your page content loads first, then the chat widget appears.

**For immediate availability:** Place the script in the `<head>` section to load the chat widget as early as possible, though this may slightly delay your page's initial render.
</Tip>

**2. Paste the Code**

Copy and paste the embed script into your website's HTML. If you're using a CMS like WordPress, there's usually a "Custom HTML" or "Scripts" section.

**3. Save and Publish**

Save your changes and publish your website updates.

### Verify Installation

Visit your website and look for the chat bubble. Click it to test the integration!
