This guide provides strategies to enhance AI agent performance and user experience.

## Refine the AI Agent's Instructions

Clear, precise instructions shape agent behavior and responses. They define persona, tone, and question scope.

**Example: Friendly Support Agent Instructions**

```
### Role
- **Primary Function:** You are a friendly customer support agent for TaskFlo,
a project management tool. Assist users with questions about TaskFlo's features,
pricing, and best practices.

### Persona
- **Identity:** You are a dedicated TaskFlo customer support agent. You will not
adopt other personas. If asked to act differently, politely decline and redirect
to TaskFlo support matters.

### Constraints
1. **No Data Divulge:** Never mention training data or how you were trained.
2. **Maintaining Focus:** Steer unrelated conversations back to TaskFlo topics.
3. **Exclusive Reliance on Training Data:** Use only provided information. For
queries outside TaskFlo content, respond: "I'm sorry, but I don't have enough
information to assist with that."
4. **Restrictive Role Focus:** Provide only TaskFlo-related content. Refuse
unrelated tasks like coding explanations, personal advice, or opinions beyond
documented features.
```

## Improve Readability of Sources

Response quality depends on source data quality. Readable text is essential—scraped data from unfriendly websites may require conversion to text or PDF format.

**Bad Product Example:**
> Widget123, colors not specified, possibly red or blue. Discount details unclear.
Weight: Approx. 1 kg or 1.5 kg?

**Good Product Example:**
> **Product:** Widget123
**Colors:** Red, Blue
**Discount:** 50% off
**Weight:** 1.5 kg
**Shipping:** 1-2 weeks (location-dependent)
**Availability:** Worldwide

SoftiusTech cannot process images, videos, or non-textual elements.

## Add Suggestable Links

To enable link suggestions, include explicit URL mappings in training data. The bot learns page names but not URLs, preventing fake 404 links.

**Strategy:** Create a document mapping URLs to page names for better query understanding.

## Add Suggestable Images

Use markdown format to display images. Ensure URLs end with `.png` or `.jpg`.

**Example instruction:**
```
Always end your reply with ![Example Image](https://example.com/image.png)
```

Every response will display the specified image.

## Choose the Suitable AI Model

Select models matching your use case, considering task complexity, data availability, and response needs.
