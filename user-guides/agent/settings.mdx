2. Find the **Off-Topic Guardrails** toggle
3. Switch between **Stay On Topic** and **Open**

<Warning>
When set to "Open," your agent may answer questions unrelated to your business, which could use more credits and may not align with your support goals.
</Warning>

## Settings Summary

## Best Practices

**Agent Name**
