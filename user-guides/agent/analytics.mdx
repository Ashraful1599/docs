The Analytics section provides insights into your AI Agent's performance, conversation volumes, response times, and customer satisfaction. Use these metrics to optimize your agent and improve customer experience.

## Overview Dashboard

### Summary Cards

Four key metrics are displayed at the top of the Analytics page:

**Total Messages**
- Total number of messages sent and received in the selected time period
- Includes both customer messages and AI responses
- Shows aggregate activity across all conversations

**Total Conversations**
- Number of unique conversations started in the time period
- Each conversation represents a customer interaction session
- Tracks how many customers engaged with your agent

**Average Response Time**
- Mean time taken by your AI Agent to respond to customer queries
- Measured in seconds or milliseconds
- Lower response times indicate better performance

**Customer Satisfaction**
- Aggregate satisfaction score based on customer feedback
- May include ratings, thumbs up/down, or other feedback mechanisms
- Helps identify areas for improvement

## Time Range Filter

Select different time periods to view analytics:

| Time Range | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Last 7 Days** | Recent activity and trends |
| **Last 30 Days** | Monthly performance overview |
| **Last 90 Days** | Quarterly insights and patterns |

When you change the time range:
- All metrics update automatically
- Charts redraw with new data
- Summary cards recalculate

## Message Volume Over Time

### Line Chart Visualization

This chart displays message activity trends:
- **X-axis**: Dates within selected time period
- **Y-axis**: Message count
- **Trend Line**: Shows message volume over time

### What to Look For

**Increasing Trend**
- Growing user engagement
- Successful deployment
- Expanding user base

**Decreasing Trend**
- Reduced engagement (investigate causes)
- Seasonal patterns
- Technical issues

**Spikes**
- Marketing campaigns
- Product launches
- Support incidents

**Valleys**
- Weekends or holidays
- Downtime
- Seasonal lulls

## Daily Activity Distribution

### Bar Chart Visualization

Shows conversation distribution by day of the week:
- **X-axis**: Days (Monday - Sunday)
- **Y-axis**: Activity count
- **Bars**: Height represents volume

### Insights

Use this chart to:
- Identify peak activity days
- Plan support staffing
- Schedule agent maintenance during low-traffic periods
- Understand user behavior patterns

**Example Patterns:**
- B2B agents often see weekday peaks
- Consumer agents may be busier on weekends
- Support queries spike on Mondays

## Using Analytics Data

### Performance Monitoring

**Response Time**
- Target: Under 2 seconds for most queries
- If slow: Check training data size, API latency, or server resources
- Optimize by reducing complex embeddings or using faster models

**Conversation Volume**
- Track growth over time
- Compare to website traffic or marketing campaigns
- Identify successful content or features

**Message Volume**
- High messages per conversation = engaged users or complex queries
- Low messages per conversation = quick resolutions or user drop-off
- Balance depends on your use case

### Optimization Strategies

**Improving Satisfaction**
1. Review negative feedback in Activity section
2. Revise AI responses that received poor ratings
3. Save improved answers as Q&A pairs
4. Monitor satisfaction score improvement

**Reducing Response Time**
1. Optimize training data (remove duplicate or irrelevant content)
2. Use more efficient AI models
3. Implement caching for common queries
4. Review server performance

**Increasing Engagement**
1. Improve agent visibility on your website
2. Use suggested messages to prompt user interaction
3. Deploy agent on high-traffic pages
4. Optimize initial messages for clarity

## Comparing Site Connections

If you have multiple site connections:
- Filter analytics by specific site
- Compare performance across sites
- Identify which sites have the most active conversations

## Data Refresh

- Analytics data updates in real-time for recent activity
- Historical data is aggregated for performance
- Time range changes fetch new data immediately

<Note>
Analytics tracks all conversations, including both AI and manual modes. Use this data to understand total customer support volume.
</Note>

## Best Practices

**Daily Monitoring**
- Check Total Messages and Conversations daily
- Look for anomalies or unexpected drops
- Respond quickly to performance issues

**Weekly Reviews**
- Review average response time trends
- Identify days with highest activity
- Plan capacity accordingly

**Monthly Analysis**
- Compare satisfaction scores month-over-month
- Analyze message volume growth
- Identify long-term trends

**Using Data for Training**
- High message volume with low satisfaction = training gaps
- Conversations with many back-and-forth messages = unclear responses
- Review Activity logs for specific examples to improve

## Exporting Data

While the dashboard provides visual insights, you can:
- Take screenshots of charts for reports
- Access detailed conversation logs in Activity section
- Use data to justify support investments or agent improvements

<Warning>
Analytics data is specific to each agent. If you have multiple agents, view analytics separately for each to understand individual performance.
</Warning>
