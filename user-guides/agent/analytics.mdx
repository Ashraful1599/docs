## Chats

The Analytics tab displays AI Agent activity during conversations, including three sections: Chats, Topics, and Sentiment. By default, it shows activity for all AI Agents in your workspace for the last week.

This section provides:

- Total number of chats
- Total number of messages
- Messages with positive feedback (thumbs up)
- Messages with negative feedback (thumbs down)
- Geographic distribution graph showing chats per country (detected from user IP addresses)

You can filter data by date using pre-defined options:
- Last 7 days
- Last 30 days
- Last 3 months
- Last year

## Topics

This section displays topics mentioned by users in conversations. The AI Agent detects topics automatically, but you can also manage them manually.

**Available actions:**
- Search topics
- Add topic
- Edit topic
- Delete topic
- Freeze topics (stops automatic topic detection)

Access manual topic management through the "View All" button on the right side of the page.

## Sentiment

This section shows how the AI Agent detects user sentiment and emotions during conversations. Sentiment analysis occurs automatically.
