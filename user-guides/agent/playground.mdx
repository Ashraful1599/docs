Test and optimize your AI agent before deployment. Compare different AI models, adjust settings like temperature and system prompts, and evaluate responses to ensure your agent performs exactly as needed for your users.

## AI Model

The AI model determines which machine learning engine generates your agent's responses. Models vary in capabilities, performance characteristics, and message credit costs.

### Available Models

**GPT:**
- GPT-5, GPT-5.1, GPT-5 Mini, GPT-5 Nano (1 credit each)
- GPT-OSS-120B, GPT-OSS-20B (1 credit each)
- GPT-4 (20 credits), GPT-4 Turbo (10 credits), GPT-4.5 (30 credits)
- GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini (1 credit each)
- o3 (10 credits), o3 Mini (1 credit), o4 Mini (2 credits)
- GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 Mini, GPT-4.1 Nano (1 credit each)

**Claude:**
- Claude 4.5 Haiku, Claude 4.5 Sonnet (1 credit each)
- Claude 4.5 Opus (10 credits), Claude 4.1 Opus (20 credits)
- Claude 4 Sonnet, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Sonnet (1 credit each)
- Claude 4 Opus, Claude 3 Opus (20 credits each)
- Claude 3 Haiku (1 credit)

**Gemini:**
- Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.0 Pro, Gemini 2.0 Flash (1 credit each)
- Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Flash (1 credit each)

**Additional Models:**
- Command R, Command R+, Command A (1 credit each)
- Llama 4 Scout, Llama 4 Maverick (1 credit each)
- DeepSeek-V3 (1 credit), DeepSeek-R1 (2 credits)
- Grok 4 (10 credits), Grok 3 (1 credit), Grok 3 mini (2 credits)
- KimiK2 (1 credit)

### Temperature

Temperature ranges from 0 to 1 and regulates response creativity:

- **Lower values (near 0):** Produces focused, consistent responses by selecting the most probable outputs
- **Higher values (near 1):** Generates more creative and varied responses with less predictability

Default is 0. Adjust to experiment with different response styles for your use case.

### AI Actions

AI Actions enable your agent to perform tasks beyond answering questions, including scheduling appointments, collecting lead information, handling billing and payments support requests using Stripe, sending Slack notifications, conducting web searches, and integrating with external systems.

Test thoroughly with various inputs to ensure proper activation and functionality. See the [Actions Overview guide](/user-guides/agent/actions/actions-overview) for complete setup details.

### System Prompt

The system prompt shapes agent personality, behavior, and response style. Establish role, conversational tone, and handling instructions for different query types.

**Key benefits:**
- Brand alignment with company communication style
- Consistent behavior across interactions
- Specialized knowledge focus
- Professional tone setting

**Best practices:**
- Specify role clearly (e.g., "customer support specialist")
- Include desired response style examples
- Set boundaries on discussion topics
- Test variations based on user feedback

Start with simple, clear purpose descriptions and progressively add specific instructions as needed.

## Compare Area

The comparison feature enables testing multiple AI agents side-by-side with different settings to identify optimal configurations.

### Comparison Controls

1. **Sync Toggle** - Uncheck to prevent messages from syncing across comparison chats
2. **Settings** - Adjust model, temperature, and prompt per agent
3. **Save** - Apply settings to main agent configuration
4. **Actions Menu** - Reposition agents, reset chat, or delete comparison

### Additional Options

- Clear all chats
- Reset to main settings
- Add new agent for testing
- Change models via filter icon

### Credit Limitations

If you see "This agent is currently unavailable. If you are the owner please check your account," you've exhausted message credits. Purchase add-on message credits to continue testing.
