The Sources section is where you manage all the training data for your AI Agent. Upload files, add text content, create Q&A pairs, and crawl websites to train your agent with relevant knowledge.

## Training Overview

View your training data summary including:
- **Total Sources** - Count of all training sources across all types
- **Training Data** - Total storage used (displayed in KB/MB)
- **Last Trained** - When your agent was last trained
- **Breakdown by Type** - See how many sources you have for Files, Text Content, Q&A, and Websites

The system automatically tracks the training state of each source and updates in real-time as processing completes.

## Files

Upload documents to train your AI Agent on existing content like manuals, FAQs, product information, and business documents.

### Supported File Types

- **PDF** (.pdf) - PDF documents
- **Text** (.txt) - Plain text files
- **Word** (.doc, .docx) - Microsoft Word documents
- **CSV** (.csv) - Comma-separated values

### Uploading Files

1. Navigate to the **Files** tab in Training
2. Drag and drop files into the upload zone, or click to browse
3. Files are processed automatically with real-time status updates
4. Character count is tracked for each file

### Processing States

Files go through several states during processing:
- **Extracting** - Text is being extracted from the file
- **Ready** - Content is ready for training
- **Training** - Embeddings are being generated
- **Trained** - Successfully indexed and ready to use
- **Failed** - Processing error occurred

### File Management

- **Preview** - Click any file to view its extracted content
- **Delete** - Remove files individually
- **Restore** - Deleted files can be restored from trash
- **Search** - Filter files by name
- **Pagination** - View 50 files per page

## Text Content

Add custom text snippets to train your agent with specific knowledge, FAQs, or formatted content.

### Creating Text Content

1. Navigate to the **Text Content** tab
2. Click **Add New** to create a snippet
3. Enter a **Title** for easy identification
4. Use the rich text editor to format your content:
   - Headings and subheadings
   - Bold, italic, underline formatting
   - Bulleted and numbered lists
   - Links to external resources
   - Code blocks and quotes

### Text Content Features

- **Rich HTML Editor** - Format content with full HTML support
- **Character Count** - Tracks storage usage per snippet
- **Edit Anytime** - Update existing content as needed
- **Search & Filter** - Find snippets quickly
- **Soft Delete** - Restore accidentally deleted content

### Best Practices

- Use descriptive titles for easy organization
- Break long content into separate snippets
- Format content clearly with headings and lists
- Include relevant keywords for better AI matching

## Q&A Pairs

Create custom question-answer pairs to ensure your AI Agent provides precise responses to specific queries.

### Creating Q&A Pairs

1. Navigate to the **Q&A** tab
2. Click **Add Q&A Pair**
3. Enter the **Question** (supports HTML formatting)
4. Enter the **Answer** (supports HTML formatting)
5. Optionally assign a **Category** for organization

### Q&A Features

- **Rich Formatting** - Format both questions and answers with HTML
- **Categories** - Organize Q&A pairs by topic
- **Bulk Import** - Import multiple Q&A pairs from CSV
- **Edit & Delete** - Modify existing pairs anytime
- **Character Tracking** - Monitor storage usage

### Creating Q&A from Conversations

You can create Q&A pairs directly from agent conversations:
1. View a conversation in the Activity section
2. Click **Revise Answer** on any AI response
3. Edit the response if needed
4. Check **Save as Q&A Pair** to add it to training data

This feature helps you continuously improve your agent based on real interactions.

### CSV Import Format

When bulk importing Q&A pairs, use this CSV format:
```
question,answer,category
"What are your hours?","We're open Monday-Friday 9am-5pm","Business Hours"
"Do you ship internationally?","Yes, we ship worldwide","Shipping"
```

## Website Crawler

Automatically extract content from websites to train your AI Agent on web-based documentation, blogs, or product pages.

### Crawling Methods

#### Full Website Crawl
1. Navigate to the **Website** tab
2. Enter the homepage URL
3. Configure crawl settings:
   - **Max Depth** - How many levels deep to crawl (default: 2)
   - **Include Paths** - Only crawl URLs matching these patterns
   - **Exclude Paths** - Skip URLs matching these patterns
4. Click **Start Crawl**

#### Individual URLs
Add specific pages without crawling an entire site:
1. Enter the URL of the page
2. Click **Add Single URL**
3. The page is fetched and processed immediately

### Crawl Settings

**Include Paths** (optional)
- Specify path patterns to crawl only specific sections
- Example: `/docs/`, `/blog/`, `/products/`
- Multiple patterns can be added

**Exclude Paths** (optional)
- Skip unwanted sections like login pages or admin areas
- Example: `/login`, `/admin`, `/cart`
- Multiple patterns can be added

**Max Depth**
- Controls how many link levels to follow from the starting URL
- Depth 1: Only the starting page
- Depth 2: Starting page + direct links
- Depth 3: Two levels of linked pages

### Website Source Management

**Hierarchical View**
- Website sources are displayed in a tree structure
- Parent URLs show child pages discovered during crawling
- Click a parent to expand and view all child pages

**Actions**
- **Recrawl** - Refresh content from the original URL
- **Cancel** - Stop an in-progress crawl
- **Delete** - Remove individual URLs or entire website sources
- **Bulk Delete** - Select multiple sources to delete at once

### Crawl Progress

Real-time updates show:
- **Crawled** - Pages successfully processed
- **Queued** - Pages waiting to be crawled
- **Total** - Total pages discovered

Progress is updated live via WebSocket connection.

### Link Limits

Your subscription plan includes a link limit. The system tracks:
- Links used across all agents
- Links available in your plan
- Upgrade prompts when approaching limits

## Training States

All training sources go through these states:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Extracting** | Processing file or fetching content |
| **Discovering** | Website crawler finding URLs |
| **Ready** | Content ready for training |
| **Training** | Generating embeddings for AI |
| **Trained** | Successfully indexed |
| **Edited** | Content modified, needs retraining |
| **Failed** | Processing error |
| **Removed** | Soft deleted (can be restored) |

## Storage & Limits

- **Character Tracking** - Each source displays character count
- **Total Storage** - View total KB/MB used across all sources
- **Plan Limits** - Different plans have different storage limits
- **Warnings** - System alerts when approaching limits

## Retraining Your Agent

After adding, editing, or deleting sources:
1. Click **Train Agent** button
2. The system generates embeddings for all new/modified content
3. Real-time progress updates show training status
4. Training typically completes in 2-5 minutes

<Note>
Your agent automatically uses all **Trained** sources when responding to queries. There's no need to manually enable individual sources.
</Note>

<Warning>
- Ensure uploaded files contain selectable text (not scanned images)
- Website crawling respects robots.txt and may be blocked by some sites
- Large files or websites may take several minutes to process
- Character limits vary by subscription plan
</Warning>
