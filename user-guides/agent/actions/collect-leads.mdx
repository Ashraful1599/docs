## Overview

The Collect Leads action enables you to customize when a lead form appears during customer conversations with your bot.

## When to Use

Specify the exact timing for displaying the lead form during conversations. You can also add instructions like "Show only the form without listing individual fields."

## Best Practices for Instructions

- Use natural language phrasing
- Keep sentences short and straightforward
- Provide examples demonstrating desired responses
- Focus on desired actions rather than restrictions
- Begin with action-oriented verbs: generate, create, provide

## Form Field Configuration

You can enable or disable three available fields:
- Name
- Email
- Phone Number

Each field can be marked as required. Maximum of three fields allowed per form.

## Customization Options

**Success Message:** Customize the message displayed when a customer submits the form.

**Dismiss Message:** Customize the message shown when a customer closes the form using the X button.

## Preview and Activation

1. Preview your settings using the AI agent on the Action page
2. Review any desired edits
3. Press enable to make your form live
