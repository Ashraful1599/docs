## Revising AI Responses

Improve AI answers and save them as training data:

### How to Revise

1. **Find the Message** - Locate the AI response to revise
2. **Click Revise Answer** - Opens the revision modal
3. **Edit the Response** - Modify the AI's answer
4. **Save as Q&A** (Optional) - Check the box to add to training data
5. **Submit** - Save your changes

### Saving as Q&A Pair

When you check "Save as Q&A Pair":
- The original question becomes the Q&A question
- Your revised answer becomes the Q&A answer
- The pair is automatically added to your Sources
- Future similar questions will use your improved response

This creates a feedback loop where you continuously improve your agent based on real interactions.

## Conversation Modes

### AI Mode
- Agent automatically responds using training data
- No human intervention required
- Best for routine questions and high volumes

### Manual Mode
- All messages wait for human response
- AI does not reply automatically
- Best for sensitive or complex cases

### Toggling Mode

Switch any conversation between modes:
1. Open the conversation
2. Click the mode toggle button
3. Select AI or Manual mode
4. Mode changes apply immediately

<Warning>
Switching to Manual mode stops AI responses. The customer will wait for a human reply.
</Warning>
